<h2>charlie bossy_</font></h2>


<p>I am a multimedia professional based in Toronto. Since 2017 I've worked as a media buyer for <a href="https://www.activeinternational.ca/experts/charlie-bossy" target="_blank">Active International.</a></p> 

<p>I previously worked in journalism and continue to sporadically write for publications. I've contributed to outlets such as food site <a href="https://thetakeout.com/canadian-a-w-burger-fast-food-worth-crossing-border-1832757524" style="color:white" target="_blank">the Takeout</a> and business newspaper <a href="https://www.investmentexecutive.com/writer/charles-bossy/" target="_blank">Investment Executive.</a></p>

<p>I've produced, scripted, and edited video and audio projects of both an artistic and corporate variety.</p>

<p>Namely I directed a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vAvIHA6Zws" target="_blank">documentary on the closing of Queen Video</a> and helmed a <a href="https://soundcloud.com/bishop-water-technologies" target="_blank">podcast for Bishop Water Technologies.</a> </p>
